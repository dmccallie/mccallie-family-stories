# More Fun than it Seems\r\n\r\nEleanor in her kickoff of the 2024 McCallie Zoomfest created the first McCallie Stories Challenge - Where did the (in)famous McCallie expression \"More fun that it seems\" originate? Here's the story!\r\n\r\n\r\nSpencer:\r\n> On a camping trip with days of rain and summer cold, two bedraggled small boys, Freddy and Alex struggled to be positive. We all huddled under tarps and talked and read, and acted as if we were not miserable. At some point Freddie said to Alex, “This is more fun than it seems.”   \r\n>\r\n> No one could have summed up the whole wet trip better. I have endured other events with that thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nWyatt:\r\n\r\n> Eleanor, my gerontologist says your warm-up exercise is very good for us! Spencer and Helen have nailed the setting. I was on that camping trip and we were not drinking (to speak of), so I still have some fuzzy memories. Everything below is prefaced with \"as best I remember,\" though I am well aware of the family maxim that says you should never let the truth get in the way of a good family story:\r\n>\r\n> Likely late summer of 1965, probably August.  Freddie and Alex were born in 1960. This was their first men's camping trip. This was the only \"men's camping trip\" I can remember where Uncle David took his boat, and we used it to ferry across a large lake to get to an isolated, single camping site with no road access. We arrived on a Thursday or Friday afternoon.\r\n>\r\n> \"Primitive\" would bestow high honors on this \"camping site.\" There were no structures, no privy, no tables, and no water supply other than the lake. A convenient, lightly sloped mud boat ramp allowed us to land right on the edge of the site.\r\n>\r\n> It was not raining when we pitched camp, but shortly thereafter a steady, cold rain started and did not fully stop through Sunday morning. Our tarps and clothing were inadequate for this amount of rain.\r\n>\r\n> We prepared, ate, and cleaned up every meal in the rain. We pottied in the rain. (Think toilet tissue.) We did not waterski. We did not hike. We did not bake marshmallows.\r\n> As Spencer alluded, mostly we just huddled under the inadequate tarps like Emperor penguins on an Antarctic ice shelf.\r\n>\r\n> We ate breakfast in the rain Sunday morning, knowing that we would soon be breaking camp in rain, which meant knowing everything would be soaked going into stuff sacks or boxes, everything would have to be taken back out in Chattanooga to dry, possibly for days, and everything would then have to be packed and stored yet again.\r\n>\r\n> Freddie and Alex stood side-by-side under a tarp, watching the rain. To their credit – and indeed to the credit of everyone – there had been no real carping throughout the trip.\r\n>\r\n> That's when Freddie – looking straight out – said, \"This is more fun than it seems.\" I treasure that I heard him say it, and as we broke camp in the rain, we all treasured that he had said it. The clouds did not melt away, but somehow the gloom did.\r\n>\r\n> Freddie's saying has lifted the gloom on many \"disastrous\" business occasions, and it is a great story for vacation trips with children and grandchildren when the flights and reservations don't go as planned. Thank you for Freddie. Thank you for family.\r\n\r\nDavid - here are pictures from those days.\r\n\r\n![add a caption here](https://mccallie-family-stories.s3.amazonaws.com/images/group-on-the-road-to-lake.jpg \"add a title here\")\r\n\r\n![add a caption here](https://mccallie-family-stories.s3.amazonaws.com/images/group-with-boat.jpg \"add a title here\")\r\n\r\n\r\nAllen:\r\n\r\n> A modern parent would look at this picture and just gasp.\r\n> What could possibly go wrong?\r\n> How did any of us survive???\r\n\r\nHelen:\r\n\r\n> Why are all the photos of my father having him sitting down?\r\n<insert helen picture?>\r\n\r\nWyatt:\r\n> Helen -- I have come to realize it was because he was SMART!\r\n\r\nJim:\r\n> “Memories are a funny thing.”  That quote comes from my mother or Aunt Queenie as most of you know her.  It was made sometime around 2004 when I asked her how she ever managed to raise five boys and one girl; I on occasion found that raising two boys was challenging enough, so I was looking for wisdom, guidance, and just plain experience from someone who had it.  Her response, “Memories are a funny thing.  As I get older, I just don’t remember any of the bad parts.  Were you bad?”  Well, I didn’t get the advice I wanted, but did feel relieved that she knew me as a good person, an easy to raise son.  \r\n>\r\n> Not many will challenge Wyatt’s memories, and neither will I.  Having said that, I will say my memory of Freddie’s statement of “That is more fun than it seems\" has another origin.   It was when he was very young and it was his first camping trip to go on.  Uncle David wasn’t sure if he was old enough to be somewhat independent and be able to rough it a bit.  The story I remember is that Uncle David made sure that if Freddie went, that he was not to complain or become despondent due to the potential circumstances.   He stated clearly to Freddie that there was to be no complaining.  So with that in mind, Freddie went on his first camping trip.  \r\n>\r\n> As Wyatt and Spencer described, it was a miserable time.  It rained almost the whole time, not just a drizzle, but a steady rain.  The location of the camping site I have forgotten.  It could have been on the lake, but I’m not sure about that, as we had several trips on a lake front.  So, skipping ahead to our return home, Freddie was asked how he “enjoyed” his first camping trip.  Having been told not to complain, he came out with his “more fun” sentence that we have enjoyed ever since.  I have used it countless times in my workshops which I have held in various countries in times past.   \r\n>\r\n> So, I am sure the Uncle David sons have a more accurate memory of the circumstances of Freddie’s statement.  I look forward to hearing their version or let’s say their memory of it.  Maybe it won’t be more accurate, but just as fun or embellished as ours.\r\n>\r\n> I’m attaching a few photos here to highlight a few facts. \r\n> 1.  Uncle Spence is often photographed in a chair, because he had the tendency to sit around and entertain us.\r\n> 2.  As one can see Uncle Spence wasn't always sitting.  He stands tall in our memories.\r\n> 3.  With the exception of a few camping trips, they were fun and not just seemed fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n![add a caption here](https://mccallie-family-stories.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jim-SJM-sitting-chair.jpg \"add a title here\")\r\n\r\n![add a caption here](https://mccallie-family-stories.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jim-SJM-smoking.jpg \"add a title here\")\r\n\r\n![add a caption here](https://mccallie-family-stories.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jim-camp-group.jpg \"add a title here\")\r\n\r\n![add a caption here](https://mccallie-family-stories.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jim-map-reading.jpg \"add a title here\")\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWyatt:\r\n\r\n> Jim's last picture of one of the men's camping groups reminds me of the movie Deliverance, which took place in the Georgia mountains only a handful of miles from Standing Indian….\r\n\r\nAllen:\r\n> The accumulated stories on the initial offering of the family saying \"this is more fun than it seems\" strike me as a lesson about truth and Truth.\r\n>\r\n> We have been treated to, I think, four different versions of the genesis of that saying. If you go back and read carefully, you will see that the factual underpinnings of each of those stories are fairly different; perhaps even dramatically different.\r\n>\r\n> I am here to tell you that none of them contain the truth.\r\n>\r\n> But all of them contain the **Truth**. \r\n>\r\n> By that, I simply mean that the versions from Spencer and Wyatt and Jim may diverge wildly on the underlying facts, but they all contain as common ingredients brother Freddy; rain;; and the words.\r\n>\r\n> I will leave it to brother Jack to impart the truth, but all of the previous narrators have gotten the Truth correctly. It  was, and is, \"more fun than it seems.\"\r\n>\r\n> And I offer this observation simply because it is a marvelous reflection of the nature of what we csll history. It changes based on the observer, and it changes with the passage of time, but somewhere beneath all of it is inevitably the Truth.\r\n>\r\n> Jack, you can fill in the facts, though they are not really important!\r\n\r\n## What really happened...\r\n\r\nJack:\r\n\r\nThe clock is ticking. As the last one to to sign on for this adventure, let me set the record straight. Truth is truth…especially after reflecting with your brother over a nice dinner and wine celebrating his birthday on Sunday.\r\n\r\nEverything that everyone has said has a certain amount of truth as Allen has said. But…\r\n\r\nWyatt‘s reflection is a bit off. He remembers a men’s camping trip to lake Aquone, the lake on the Nantahala river a few hundred yards upstream from our beloved Appletree campground. We ended up perched on a future homesite that we accessed by Dad’s boat and car. I remember a Volvo (think 1960’s SUV) stuck in the mud.\r\n\r\nJim and Spencer’s recollection of rain is valid.\r\n\r\nAlec was an innocent bystander.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the quote attributed to brother Freddy was on *Hiwassee* lake several years prior. It was a wet and miserable experience. I believe Bob Toms was on that trip.\r\n\r\nWhen Freddy said it will always be shrouded in mystery. The meaning of it is timeless. \r\n\r\nI would reflect on the version that brings this message to heart. This was my dad‘s favorite story about Freddie and his early camping days.\r\n\r\nWe were at Seven  Springs which is nearby on Lake Hiwassee. (Reflected in the pictures of Jim and my family with all the tools of a good trip…boats and boys). This might have been a men’s camping trip or it may have been the David Mccallie‘s camping trip. It doesn’t matter. It was still “more fun than it seemed“.\r\n\r\nFreddie was young. He had been out for several days having a great time and it became apparent that Freddie had not had a bowel movement for several days and as a kid was pretty uncomfortable. He had never “pooped in the woods”.\r\n\r\nThis was a life lesson not learned nor experienced. Kids today can read a book on it or google it.His father recognized this, and tried to help him understand the finer arts of going to the bathroom in the woods.  He gave Freddy some instructions. Freddy went out, sat on the ground and nothing happened. He was getting miserable. So Daddy gave him some better instructions on how to sit on a log or squat or do something but let it just happen.\r\n\r\nNothing happened. Freddie became more miserable. His father became more concerned as his son suffered on his early camping experience.  The wise scientist, physician, and father came up with a brilliant idea. He took a box and cut out a hole appropriately shaped to reflect the image what every child would know as a commode. He took it to the woods and instructed his son to go out and do his business. Nothing happened.\r\n\r\nThe situation was getting desperate.  In an act of desperation, his father loaded him in the car and went on a journey. They came to the Ogreeta  Baptist church, a nearby, one room, southern Baptist establishment with an outbuilding  that look to serve the purpose. It had one door, one seat, many  flies and lots of odor. Most importantly it had privacy. Heaven on Earth! An answer to prayers!\r\n\r\nInstructing his son to go in and “do your business“ ….it was a successful adventure. The day were saved! The camping trip was more fun than it seemed, and this would be the beginning of a long illustrious career. \r\n\r\nDaddy would break out in tears, laughing when he retold this story, thinking about his taking his son to the Ogreeta Baptist Church to have his first outdoor experience in the woods. He loved that story, and it was a reflection of the positive experience of an adventure in the woods with family … in private.\r\n\r\nThis is what it’s all about. \r\n\r\n![add a caption here](https://mccallie-family-stories.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jack-ogretta-church-cropped.jpg \"add a title here\")\r\n\r\nOgreeta NC is on Google maps outside of Murphy. No Baptist church by the name… must have been absorbed… or fell down. It served its purpose.\r\n\r\nSmile, laugh and be family!
